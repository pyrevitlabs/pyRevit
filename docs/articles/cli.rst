pyRevit CLI Utility
===================

pyRevit has a command line utility tool that helps managing pRevit clones,
extensions and configurations, a lot easier.

**Documentation**
The documentation for this tool is provided in a markdown file inside the
pyrevit repository. The reason is that the cli tool knows the link to its own
help based on its versions, to the markdown file on the repo, and can direct
the user to it upon running ``pyrevit help``.
It made more sense to maintain the help in a single file inside the repo, 
rather than a more complex documentation like this that needs sphinx to generate
the actual documentation pages.
